 static void bubbleSort(int[] arr) {
    int temp = 0;
    for(int i=0; i < arr.length; i++){
        for(int j=1; j < (arr.length - i); j++){
        if(arr[j-1] > arr[j]){
//swap elements
            temp = arr[j-1];
            arr[j-1] = arr[j];
            arr[j] = temp;
            } // if close
        } // inner for loop close
    } // outer for loop close
} // end of method
